               <strong> Machine learning (ML):</strong>
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task. ML systems can improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. Common applications include recommendation systems, image recognition, and fraud detection.

               <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> 
    Artificial Intelligence is a broader field of computer science aimed at creating machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This includes problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, and language understanding. AI encompasses multiple techniques, including machine learning, expert systems, and natural language processing.
                
                <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> 
    Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data comes with corresponding output labels. The model learns to map inputs to correct outputs by minimizing the error between its predictions and the actual labels. Common examples include classification (e.g., identifying spam emails) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
                
                <strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> 
    Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that has no labels. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures in the data. This type of learning is often used for clustering (grouping similar items, like customer segmentation) or dimensionality reduction (simplifying the data without losing key information). Common algorithms include k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA).
                
                <strong> Deep Learning:</strong>
    Deep learning is a specialized area of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep"). These models are capable of learning from vast amounts of data, and they excel in tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. Deep learning has gained significant attention due to its high performance in tasks that involve unstructured data, such as text, audio, and images. Examples include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
